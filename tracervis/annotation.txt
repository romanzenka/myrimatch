Myrimatch
Myrimatch is a proteomics search engine that matches mass spectra to theoretical spectra derived from a protein database.
Its output is basically a best matching peptide for each spectrum.

sort spectra by id
Sort spectra
It is not clear why is this operation performed. Possibly for performance reasons?
The spectra are sorted by their ID.

myrimatch::InitProcess
Read parameters
This operation reads the command-line parameters and prepares the search engine.

myrimatch::InitWorkerGlobals
Preprocess spectra
Here we already know the list of spectra to be processed.
We prepare the engine for work using this extra knowledge.

Determine the maximum seen charge state
Determine the maximum seen charge state
Knowing what is the maximum charge state of a spectrum allows us to optimize the search space.
For instance, we can determine what is the maximum peptide length (in amino acids) within our mass window.
